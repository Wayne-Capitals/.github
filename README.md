## ü¶á Organization Guidelines


1. **Batman References:**  Every repository must have a reference to Batman lore, whether in the repository name, README, or project structure. Creativity is encouraged!


2. **Professionalism & Quality:**  Like Bruce Wayne's enterprises, we maintain high standards of professionalism, structure, and clean code practices.


3. **Collaboration & Vigilance:**  Work together as a league, review code thoroughly, and ensure every contribution adds value.


4. **Code of Conduct:**  Maintain respect for fellow contributors, engage in meaningful discussions, and keep contributions ethical and constructive.

## ü¶á Code Guidelines


To maintain consistency and quality across our projects, we follow a structured coding standard:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Naming Conventions

**Variables & Functions:** Use camelCase (e.g., batSignalStrength, detectJokerLocation())

**Constants**:  Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., GOTHAM_NIGHT_MODE)

**CSS Classes:**  Use lowercase-with-hyphens (e.g., .dark-knight-theme, .wayne-tech-button)

**File Names:**  Use kebab-case for frontend files and PascalCase for React components (e.g., batman-utils.js, JokerTracker.jsx)


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Repository Naming

Every repository should reflect a reference to Batman lore. Examples:

gotham-guardian (for security-related projects)

batcave-database (for databases and backend projects)

wayne-tech-ui (for frontend UI libraries)

arkham-simulator (for simulations and AI-driven projects)


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Git Commit Guidelines

Descriptive Messages: Use clear and meaningful commit messages (e.g., Fix: Improved Batarang throwing accuracy algorithm)

Prefixes:

**Feat:** for new features

**Fix:** for bug fixes

**Refactor:** for code restructuring

**Docs:** for README or documentation updates

**Chore:** for minor changes and maintenance



### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Code Review & PRs

Every PR should be reviewed by at least one other contributor.

Provide clear descriptions and references to related issues.

Link PRs to relevant GitHub Issues when applicable.

Follow the Wayne Capitals Code of Honor: clean, efficient, and readable code.
